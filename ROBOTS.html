<P style="color:red;"> 
A robot is a machine designed to execute one or more tasks automatically with speed and precision. There are as many different types<br>
 of robots as there are tasks for them to perform.
<br>


Robots that resemble humans are known as androids; however, many robots aren't built on the human model.
 Industrial robots, for example, are often designed to perform repetitive tasks that aren't facilitated by a human-like construction.<br>
 A robot can be remotely controlled by a human operator, sometimes from a great distance.<br>
 A telechir is a complex robot that is remotely controlled by a human operator for a telepresence system,
 which gives that individual the sense of being on location in a remote, dangerous or alien environment and the ability to <br>
interact with it. Telepresence robots, which simulate the experience and some of the capabilities of being physically present,
 can enable remote business consultations, healthcare, home monitoring and childcare, among many other possibilities.<br>

An autonomous robot acts as a stand-alone system, complete with its own computer (called the controller). The most advanced example is the<br>
 smart robot, which has a built-in artificial intelligence (AI) system that can learn from its environment and its experience and build on<br> 
its capabilities based on that knowledge.<br>

Swarm robots, sometimes referred to as insect robots, work in fleets ranging in number from a few to thousands, with all fleet members<br>
 under the supervision of a single controller. The term arises from the similarity of the system to a colony of insects, where the <br>
individuals and behaviors are simple but the fleet as a whole can be sophisticated.<br>

Robots are sometimes grouped according to the time frame in which they were first widely used. First-generation 
robots date from the 1970s and consist of stationary, nonprogrammable, electromechanical devices without sensors.<br> 
Second-generation robots were developed in the 1980s and can contain sensors and programmable controllers. Third-generation robots
 were developed between approximately 1990 and the present. These machines can be stationary or mobile, autonomous or insect type, <br>
with sophisticated programming, speech recognition and/or synthesis, and other advanced features. Fourth-generation robots are in the 
research-and-development phase, and include features such as artificial intelligence, self-replication, self-assembly, and nanoscale size <br>
(physical dimensions on the order of nanometers, or units of 10-9 meter).<br>

Some advanced robots are called androids because of their superficial resemblance to human beings. Androids are mobile, <br>
usually moving around on wheels or a track drive (robots legs are unstable and difficult to engineer). The android is not 
necessarily the end point of robot evolution. Some of the most esoteric and powerful robots do not look or behave anything like humans.<br> 
The ultimate in robotic intelligence and sophistication might take on forms yet to be imagined.<br>

The term comes from a Czech word, robota, meaning "forced labor." The word robot first appeared in a 1920 play by Czech writer Karel<br>
 Capek, R.U.R.: Rossum's Universal Robots. In the play, the robots eventually overthrow their human creators. One early example of <br>
a robotic design dates back to about 1478: Leonardo da Vinci's car, a spring-driven autonomous system that was likely created to cause<br>
 a sensation at court.   <br>   </P>

<dt><b><u> 1.SAFETY</b></u><dt>
<dd>Safety is the most obvious advantage of utilizing robotics. Heavy machinery, machinery that runs at hot temperature, and sharp objects can<br>
easily injure a human being. By delegating dangerous tasks to a robot, you�re more likely to look at a repair billthan a serious medical<br> 
bill or a lawsuit.Employees who work dangerous jobs will be thankful that robots can remove some of the risks.<br> <dd>

<dt>	 <b>      <u>              2. SPEED 		</b></u> 	</dt>

<dd>Robots don�t get distracted or need to take breaks. They don�t request vacation time or ask to leave an hour early. A robot will never<br> 
feel stressed out and start running slower. They also don�t need to be invited to employee meetings or training session.Robots can work <br>
all the time, and this speeds up production. They keep your employees from having to overwork themselves to meet high pressure deadlines <br>
or seemingly impossible standards.</dd><br>

<dt> <b> <u>  3. Consistency </b> </u> <dt>

<dd>Robots never need to divide their attention between a multitude of things. Their work is never contingent on the work of other people. They won�t have unexpected emergencies, 
and they won�t need to be relocated to complete a different time sensitive task. They�re always there, and they�re doing what they�re supposed to do. Automation is typically far 
more reliable than human labor.

<dt> <b> <u> 4. Perfection </b> </u> <dt>


<dd>Robots will always deliver quality. Since they�re programmed for precise, repetitive motion, they�re less likely to make mistakes. In some ways, robots are simultaneously an 
employee and a quality control system. A lack of quirks and preferences, combined with the eliminated possibility of human error, will create a predictably perfect product every 
time.</dd>

<dt> <b> <u> 5. Happier Employees </b> </u> <dt>

<dd>Since robots are often assigned to perform tasks that people don�t particularly enjoy, like menial work, repetitive motion, or dangerous jobs, your employees are more likely to be
 happy. They�ll be focusing on more engaging work that�s less likely to grind down their nerves. They might want to take advantage of additional educational opportunities,
 utilize your employee wellness program, or participate in an innovative workplace project. They�ll be happy to 
let the robots do the work that leaves them feeling burned out.</dd>

<dt> <b> <u> 6. Job Creation  </b> </u> <dt>


<dd>Robots dont take jobs away. They merely change the jobs that exist. Robots need people for monitoring and supervision. The more robots we need, the more people we�ll need to
 build those robots. By training your employees to work with robots, you�re giving them a reason to stay motivated in their position with your company. They�ll be there for the 
advancements and theyll have the unique opportunity to develop a new set of tech or engineering related skills.</dd>

<dt> <b> <u> 7. Productivity  </b> </u> <dt>


<dd>Robots can�t do everything. Some jobs absolutely need to be completed by a human. If your human employees aren�t caught up doing the things that could have easily be left for 
robots, they�ll be available and productive. They can talk to customers, answer emails and social media comments, help with branding and marketing, and sell products. You�ll be 
amazed at how much they can accomplish when the grunt work isn�t weighing them down.</dd>

 <p style="color:brown;">
         However, despite these pluses, there are clear disadvantages of the utilization of robotics in the home. Many may
 think there are no negative factors that robots bring to the table, that they help us, make life easier, and are harmless. But in retrospect, giving robots too much access to our daily lives could lead to disaster worldwide. There are three major points that can be considered the leading disadvantages of the usage of robots. First, robotics cannot respond in times of danger as humans can. Next, the production and purchasing of robots is very expensive and in this time of economic crisis this could harm the global economy. Finally, robots have a specific job to do that is ordered by their operator, and if the robot malfunctions, this could cause chaos. In addition, we humans could become overly dependant upon robot technology.<br>

Back tracking to the subject of the advantages of robots and how they can aid the disabled and elderly, we have 
to also understand that these people can find themselves in dangerous situations that cannot be handled by robots. We cannot invest our entire trust in robots to care and give companionship to our family members. If an emergency does occur, the robot is not going to be able to dial 911 and give the emergency services the vital information they need.<br> 

The next disadvantage of robotics in the home is its high cost of for both the production and the purchasing. <br>
I will explain more about the economics of robotics in the home in the next section, but for now I want to focus
 on the disadvantages of them. Robots cost millions of dollars to build and companies are investing vast amounts
 of money in the involved research and programming. Robotics is currently being used in factories across the world and people have been increasingly losing their jobs as robots become more efficient and precise than humans (N/A Author, 2011). But robotics in the home could cause also conflict because not everyone is going to financially be able to own one, even if they really need it. Even now, robots used such as the Roomba and Scooba cost a significant amount of money, and they just do trivial tasks. And if companies keep investing in this business and it eventually fails, it could cause catastrophic fall in the stock market. <br>

The final disadvantage is the ensuing human dependence on technology and robotics in the home. Even today,
people depend on technology and could not bear to go a day without it, and this technology is nowhere near as 
nifty and advanced as robots. An excellent example of what could come to be is the Disney film Wall-E 
Morris, 2008). In this film, society is falling apart and the humans are depending on robots to rebuild it. <br>
On a smaller scale, this could start in the homes across the world. Simple things such as getting up from the 
couch to make dinner and cleaning the house keep us active and moving. If robots complete all of these tasks ,
what will make us move from the couch and stay active? Our dependence on robots will cause huge changes in 
society, and most definitely not for the better human </p>
